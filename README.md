# NegativeResultDetector
Documentation, code and data for the study "Classifying Positive Results in Clinical Psychology Using Natural Language Processing" by Louis Schiekiera, Jonathan 
Diederichs & Helen Niemeyer. The preprint for this study is available on [PsyArxiv](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/uxyzh).

The best-performing model, SciBERT, was deployed under the name *'NegativeResultDetector'* on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ClinicalMetascience/NegativeResultDetector). It can be used directly via a graphical user interface for single abstract evaluations or for larger-scale inference by downloading the model files from HuggingFace, utilizing this [script](https://github.com/schiekiera/NegativeResultDetector/blob/main/Scripts/example_folder/Predict_Example_Abstracts_using_NegativeResultDetector.ipynb) from the GitHub repository.

## Abstract  
**Background:** This study addresses the gap in machine learning tools for positive results classification by evaluating the performance of SciBERT, a transformer model pretrained on scientific text, and random forest in clinical psychology abstracts. 

**Methods:** Over 1,900 abstracts were annotated into two categories: ‘positive results only’ and ‘mixed or negative results’. Model performance was evaluated on three benchmarks. The best-performing model was utilized to analyze trends in over 20,000 psychotherapy study abstracts.

**Results:** SciBERT outperformed all benchmarks and random forest in in-domain and out-of-domain data. The trend analysis revealed non-significant effects ofpublication year on positive results for 1990-2005, but a significant decrease in positive results between 2005-2022.  When examining the entire time-span, significant positive linear and negative quadratic effects were observed.

**Discussion:** Machine learning could support future efforts to understand patterns of positive results in large data sets. The fine-tuned SciBERT model was deployed for public use.
